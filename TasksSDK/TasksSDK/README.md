#  Tasks

1. Mastermind game
Create a mastermind game:
At the start, generate a random string of 4 characters ranging from A to Z. Print out the random string on the console for convenience.
On the screen should be 4 boxes where the user can input a letter on each. Next to the boxes is a 'Check' button.
When the user presses the check button, the boxes should change color following these rules:
GREEN -> When the character is in the right spot ORANGE -> When the character is in the random string but not in the right spot RED -> When the character is not in the random string
Make sure that the logic is testable
Best of luck!
2. Traffic light
Create a traffic light.
Create an app that has 1 screen. On the screen are 3 circles aligned vertically: RED, ORANGE (or yellow) and GREEN. 
The color intensity of the circles should change to which light is active. They should act like a real traffic light:
RED – 4 seconds bright
GREEN – 4 seconds bright
ORANGE – 1 second bright
The lights should quickly fade when turned on or off.
Use design patterns, unit test and try to impress us ;)
Best of luck!
